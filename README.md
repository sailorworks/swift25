## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### SwiftUI – The UI Powerhouse 🎨
SwiftUI handles all the visible elements in the game:
- **Dynamic UI updates** – Using `@State`, `@StateObject`, and `@Published` for seamless changes.
- **Timers & Alerts** – Countdown animations and pop-up messages for feedback.
- **Modern, efficient design** – Clean UI that just works.

### RealityKit – The AR MVP ✨
RealityKit powers all the AR interactions:
- **Anchored game board** – The board stays fixed in the real world, not just floating randomly.
- **Intuitive interactions** – Tap and move game pieces with ease.
- **High-quality rendering** – Crisp visuals for an ultra-realistic experience.
- **Seamless tracking** – Keeps track of all game pieces and their positions.
